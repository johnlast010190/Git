Description
    Custom findModule for IMATH

[----------------------------------------------------------------------------]]


# N.B: IMATH is only required by ALEMBIC, so its detection could be moved to FindALEMEBIC

# N.B.  IMath headers are not in standard include dir (*/include/),
# instead, Imath project assumes that headers base dir is */include/imath/.
