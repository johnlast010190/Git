# Overview
The diffuserIntake case is based on the experimental setup of E. Schulein et
al. "Documentation of Two-Dimensional Impinging Shock/Turbulent Boundary Layer
Interaction Flow", DLR Report DLR IB 223-96 A 49, 1996.

# Mesh configuration
The case includes a parameterised blockMeshDict file, which contains a parameter
'plateAngle' corresponding to the angle of the top (inclined) plate. The
plateAngle is currently set to 10 degrees, to match the 'beta = 10' case in the
reference.

# Experimental data
The reference provides measurements of the pressure (p) and friction coefficient
(Cf) on the bottom (hortizontal) plate. The case is configured to calculate Cf
using the 'skinFrictionCoeff' function object. The 'createGraphs' script
compares the calculated values of Cf and p with the experimental measurements,
for a plateAngle of 10 degrees.
