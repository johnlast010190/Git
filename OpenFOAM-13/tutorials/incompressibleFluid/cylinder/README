# Overview
The cylinder case is configured with a Reynolds number (Re) = 1.  It runs with:
+ constant/momentumTransport: simulationType laminar;
+ system/fvSchemes/ddtSchemems: default steadyState.

# Changing Reynolds number
The case includes a parameterised blockMeshDict file, in which the domain size
and mesh scales with the specified 'diameter'.  The Re can be controlled by
modifying the diameter, inlet velocity ('Uinlet' in 0/U file) and/or 'nu' in
constant/physicalProperties.

# Turbulence modelling
If the Re is increased to a level where turbulence is expected, the
'simulationType' can be changed to 'RAS' and the case includes the necessary
turbulence fields for the default model.

# Transient simulation
The fvSchemes and fvSolution files include comments instructing the user how to
switch the case to a transient simulation, e.g. when vortex shedding occurs at
higher Re.
