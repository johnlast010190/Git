# Note on the moodyChart case
The moodyChart case is a single simulation that generates points on the Moody
chart, i.e. friction factor versus Reynolds number.  It plots the points on a
graph, comparing them with the curve fit to the Moody chart data by S.E. Haaland
in "Simple and Explicit Formulas for the Friction Factor in Turbulent Pipe
Flow", J. Fluids Eng., 1983.
