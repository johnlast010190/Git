# Note on the roomHeating case
The roomHeating case based on an example from the book "Notes on Computational
Fluid Dynamics" by C.J. Greenshields and H.G Weller, see:
https://doc.cfd.direct/notes/cfd-general-principles/heating-a-room

# Changes from the book example
Compared to the example in the book, the case differs in the following ways:
+ the mesh is larger, so resolves the wall boundary layers better;
+ it uses more realistic heat transfer coefficients.
