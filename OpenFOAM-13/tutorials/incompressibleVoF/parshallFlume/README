# Overview
The parshallFlume case simulates the flow of water through a constriction in a
flume. The geometry is based on flume 13 from ISO 9826:1992, "Measurement of
liquid flows in open channels - Parshall and SAIIRI flumes", 1992.

# Function object
The case contains a 'flumeMonitor' function object to monitor the volumetric
flow rate, Froude number and water height on two planes upstream of the throat
and two planes downstream of the throat.

# Empirical correlation
flumeMonitor also uses the empirical correlation from Table 3 in ISO 9826:1992
to estimate the volumetric flow rate from the water height immediately upstream
of the throat.
